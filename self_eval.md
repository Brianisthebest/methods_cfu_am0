# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
    - I'm feeling more comfortable than when we first started. I've been able to figure out what I've needed to do so far relatively easily.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
    - This is something I think I'll be practicing a little more on my own time. Right now I was able to work through any issues I came across, but I'd like to feel more confident in myself.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
    - I feel like most of the methods we build during this section weren't anything too crazy. What's it typically look like out in the real world?
